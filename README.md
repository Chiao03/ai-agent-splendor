# Splendor Autonomous Agent

**Course:** COMP90054 – AI Planning for Autonomy, University of Melbourne  
**Tools & Technologies:** Python, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Reinforcement Learning, Git  
**Project Type:** AI & Autonomous Agent Development  

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing an autonomous agent capable of playing the board game Splendor, a resource-management strategy game. The goal was to create an AI agent that can make strategic decisions under uncertainty, compete effectively against other agents, and adapt to dynamic game situations.  
The project emphasizes AI planning, decision-making, and problem-solving in sequential environments, demonstrating practical applications of algorithms in real-time scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Agent:** Implements multiple AI techniques to select optimal moves in real-time.
- **AI Techniques Used:**
  - **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** For simulating future game scenarios and selecting moves.
  - **Minimax Algorithm:** Uses a decision tree to evaluate possible moves, simulating opponent responses to choose optimal actions.
  - **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning):** Enables the agent to learn from past outcomes and improve performance over time.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Agent adapts strategies depending on game state, resource availability, and opponents’ behavior.
- **Modular Python Implementation:** Well-structured, commented, and easy to extend for testing new AI strategies.
